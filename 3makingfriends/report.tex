  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? 
                Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? 
                What takes the majority of the time?}

                Our solution passes all the tests.
                The largest input takes roughly 8 seconds.
                The reading from file, and construction of edges for the algorithm to use, 
                takes 6.7/8 seconds for the largest file

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution?
                Which data structures were used?
                Which modifications to these data structures were used?
                What is the overall running time? Why?}
                
                We created a few functions to build and parse the data.
                Then we implemented the algorithm accordingly.
                We used both deques and lists to implement a union-find data-structure,
                these were the fastest alternatives.
                The overall running time is around 9 seconds.

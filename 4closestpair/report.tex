  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? 
                Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input?
                What takes the majority of the time?}
                
                All solutions were correct.
                Largest input file finishes in 6.3s on average.
                It's pretty equal between reading in the file and computing the result.

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? 
                Which data structures were used?
                Which modifications to these data structures were used? 
                What is the overall running time?}

                See code.
                The built in python list was used exclusively.
                None.
                The overall running time is on average 7.5 seconds.
